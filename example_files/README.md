# MAG_ML



## Overview

Scripts for machine learning, specifically on classifying MAGs from different agroindustrial residues using known lactic acid, chain elongators, and lachnospiraceae genomes. Results are from Abel's script for both training and testing files.

Using [this site](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/classification-with-python-automl/) as a guide.

## Files

Example files for input and the output file from running the script

- x_test.txt = data for testing
- x_train.txt = data for training
- y_train.txt = classification for training
- y_predicted.txt = output of ML algorithm
